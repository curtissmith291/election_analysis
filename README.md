Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used fairly easily for other elections as the script is written to be dynamically populated(i.e., the number of votes, counties, or candidates will not affect the script). 

Some ways the script could be modified to present useful data:
1) Include graphs to visually display the percentages of the counties/candidates
2) More granular geographic distribution of vote (e.g., by zip code)
